Decision Trees


#### What are the basic concepts? What problem does it solve?
- a type of Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
- Same formula as linear regression, but instead of the continuous Y, it is regressing for the probability of an event (which is binary)
- the regression fits an S-shaped logistic function

#### What are the assumptions?
- Outcome variable is binary
- linearity between log(odds) and predictor variables
- no collinearity between independent variables

#### What are the steps of the algorithm?


#### What is the cost function?

#### What are the advantages/disadvantages?
